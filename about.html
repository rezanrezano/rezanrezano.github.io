			<h2>ABOUT ME:</h2>
			<p>My name is Rezan Eezaldin Othman, and <br>
				I am from Qamshlo, Syria. <br>
				Web Developer from Flatiron School|Erbil (Re:Coded)</p>
				<p>I am a junior full-stack web developer with a desire to be the best video game developer in the Middle East. <br> I have strong technical and interpersonal skills and aspire to work in a challenging and fast paced team environment. </p>

				<h3>A glimpse of my life:</h3>
				<h4>Before Re:Coded</h4>
				<p>I was born in Syria. <br>I was studing in Syria, until I reached my first semester in university. <br>
					I got my baccalaureate in 2015 and then I moved to the university to study at the Faculty of Economics at Al-Furat University in Al-Hasakah, <br> but I could not complete my studies there because of the war conditions in my country which began in 2011 and worsened year after year. <br>
					This is why I was forced to leave my country, leave my family, my friends, my studies <br> and travel to Iraq. Here, I continued my studies, started to build my future, and gain some of the security and stability that we lacked in our country because of the war.
				</p>
				<h4>Why I joined Re:Coded:</h4>
				<p>After leaving Syria and arriving in Iraq, I moved to live with my brother in Erbil in a Syrian refugee camp. I was planning to complete my university studies at a university in Erbil, but I was unable to present my school documents because I arrived at the end of 2015.
					At that time, the university registration deadline was over and I was thinking that I had lost one year of my studies.
					I decided to find something that would benefit me until the new school year.
					I'm good at computer maintenance, and I worked with my friend in computer and mobile maintenance.
					During a short period of work in that area, my brother told me about Re:coded, and its objectives. <br>

					I dreamed that one day I could become a developer of the video games and I saw that Re:Coded can help me achieve my dream. <br>
					
					I joined Re:Coded to become a skillful programmer,and reach my dream of becoming a game developer. <br>
					Now  I managed to learn many coding Languages from Re:Coded, such as: <br>
					Ruby/Rails, AngularJS, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS,SQL, VBA Access <br> <br>
					Every thing in my life has improved with Re:Coded.
				</p>
				
				<h4>After Re:Coded:</h4>
				During my studies at Re:Coded
				I was able to enter university, in Erbil, .in the Faculty of Computer Science. <br>
				And now I aspire to graduate from university, and
				put everything I learned in Re:Coded to use. I hope to enter the world of developing video games and create a lot of applications that would add help
				and a distinctive touch to the world.
